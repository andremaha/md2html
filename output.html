<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>As we’re moving to our second monetisation strategy - Audio Advertisement - we need to be able to know more about our listeners. </p>
<p>So that we can target the users with the native Audio Advertisements better.</p>
<p>For our advertisers we need to answer following questions: what topics our users are listening to? How many users listened to articles about cars this month? What are the users that are listening about summer vacation? </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>Article-Level</h3>
<p>Since we’re analysing the texts for <strong>Topics Classifier</strong>, we should store additional information about the articles.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the keywords? </li>
<li>What topic clusters can be built? </li>
<li>Show me all the articles about cars. </li>
<li>Show me all the articles about summer vacation. </li>
<li>Show me all articles of type <strong>Interview</strong> that talk about <strong>Personal Finances.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>User-Level</h3>
<p>We also need to build user profile clusters - so that we can address those users directly. Show me all the users that listened to articles about cars last month. Show me all the users that listened to <strong>interviews</strong> that contained “summer vacation”, but did not contain “planes”. Show me all the users interested in “dogs”, but not in “horses”.</p>
